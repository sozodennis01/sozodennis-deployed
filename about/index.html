<meta name=title content="About"><meta name=description content="About Me
Hi, I’m Dennis! I’m a Computer Engineering student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and an AFROTC cadet working toward commissioning into the Space Force. I have a background in Business Information Technology and Computer Science, and I’m passionate about space operations, artificial intelligence, and building cool things with embedded systems.
When I’m not studying or in uniform, you’ll probably find me surfing the waves in Oahu, snapping photos, or making videos that capture the beauty of island life. I’m all about learning, staying active, and finding ways to make a positive impact in the world.
